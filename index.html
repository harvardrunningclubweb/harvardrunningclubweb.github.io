								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hcrc_full-team.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<div>
									<h1>Overview</h1>
									We’re a group of Harvard affiliates (mostly undergrads, but grad students, faculty, and staff are all welcome!) who love to run as a group. We have practice 5 times per week (M-F) with a variety of running routes and workouts. All paces and distances are welcome, and we love to welcome both new and experienced runners. HCRC races too! We attend NIRCA (intercollegiate club running) cross country races in the fall semester and track meets in the spring. Members get their race fees covered! All practices and races are optional, but we love to see everyone's smiling faces at name circle!
								</div>
								<br>
								<div>
									<h1>Membership</h1>
									The HCRC is open to all Harvard affiliates. You don't need to be a member to run with us, but members have their race fees covered, get our super awesome t-shirt, and can rep Harvard with our racing singlets. All you need to become a member is $30 per semester or $50 per year, the ability to find the MAC steps, and the heart of a gazelle - minus that last thing. We also offer no-questions-asked financial aid!
								</div>
								<br>
								<div>
									<h1>Questions</h1>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">When is the <span style="color: #e07;">first day</span> of practice?</h1>
										First day of practice for the Fall 2022 semester is Tuesday, September 6th at 4:45pm.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #b05;">Where</span>, <span style="color: #f06;">when</span>, and <span style="color: #724;">how fast</span> do you run?</h1>
										We run year-round in greater Boston, mostly in Boston and Cambridge (Charles River, Downtown, Fresh Pond, Tufts). We meet Mondays through Fridays at the steps of the Malkin Athletic center on weekdays at 4:45pm. Pace varies based on the day's run and the group, but we'll gladly run any pace :).
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Do you need to be a <span style="color: #e07;">member</span> to run with HCRC?</h1>
										No, and we'll never require that. Membership is available to all Harvard affiliates, and only members can run in NIRCA-sanctioned races. We also waive the costs (entrance and transportation) of these meets for members.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Does HCRC have a <span style="color: #e07;">schedule</span> for practices?</h1>
										Yes, although it is very loose. Generally, our more diffcult practices are Tuesdays (track/interval/hill workouts) and Thursdays (tempos at Fresh Pond). Our longer, slower runs are on Mondays and Wednesdays, while Fridays are our easiest day of the week, when we encourage members to bring new friends to practice!
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Does the club do anything <span style="color: #b05;">outside of running</span>?</h1>
										Of course! Movie nights, team dinners, sushi days, parties, and retreats are also in our repertoire.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Is there a <span style="color: #724;">mailing list</span>?</h1>
										What kind of Harvard club would we be without one? harvardrunningclub@lists.hcs.harvard.edu. Email <a href="mailto: harvardrunningclub@gmail.com" target="_blank">our club email</a> if you want to be on it. We pinky promise to only send the highest of quality emails.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Does HCRC have <span style="color: #f06;">social media</span> page?</h1>
										We're run-fluencers! Check out our instagram @hcrcinsta or <a title="HCRC Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/Harvard-College-Running-Club-490706610975254/?fref=ts">our Facebook page</a>, and throw us a like!
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Why are there no <span style="color: #f06;">jokes</span> on this page?</h1>
										Look at the url of this page. Ha! Madest thou look! So endeth the trick.

									We run in and around Camrbidge, Sommerville, Boston, and sometimes beyond! Some of our favorites are the class "River Left" along the Charles River towards downtown Boston and "River Right" along the Charles away from the city, turning around at whichever one of the many bridges we feel like crossing. Our Thursday tempos loop around Fresh Pond, and our Track Tuesdays happen at Harvard's track by Harvard Stadium. We love to explore new routes and paths, so we are always open to suggestions!
